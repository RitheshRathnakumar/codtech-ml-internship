# CodTech Machine Learning Internship Projects

This repository contains my solutions for the four tasks assigned during the CodTech Machine Learning internship.

## Tasks Overview

### Task 1: Decision Tree Classification
- Built and visualized a Decision Tree model using the Iris dataset.
- Used `scikit-learn` for training and `matplotlib` for visualization.
- Achieved high accuracy and interpreted model structure.

### Task 2: Sentiment Analysis
- Performed sentiment analysis on customer reviews using TF-IDF vectorization.
- Implemented Logistic Regression for classification.
- Showcased data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

### Task 3: CNN for Image Classification
- Built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow.
- Trained the model on the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits.
- Evaluated performance and visualized training accuracy.

### Task 4: Recommendation System
- Created a user-based collaborative filtering recommendation system.
- Used cosine similarity to find similar users.
- Recommended movies based on preferences of similar users.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.10
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- matplotlib
- TensorFlow
- Jupyter Notebook

## How to Run
1. Clone the repo.
2. Install required packages (see each task folder).
